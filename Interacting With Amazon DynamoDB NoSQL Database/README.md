# Interacting with Amazon DynamoDB NoSQL Database  

## Overview  

This project explores **Amazon DynamoDB**, a high-performance, serverless **NoSQL database** designed for key-value and document-based storage. The primary focus is to apply **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations**, understand query mechanisms, and optimize data retrieval.  

## Project Structure  

The repository consists of the following files:  

- **`DynamoDB_Exercise.ipynb`** â€“ A Jupyter Notebook containing guided exercises for performing CRUD operations in DynamoDB.  
- **`DynamoDB_Solution.ipynb`** â€“ A solution notebook with the correct queries and expected outputs for reference.  

## Learning Objectives  

By completing this project, I have:  

âœ… Understood the **fundamentals of Amazon DynamoDB**  
âœ… Performed **CRUD operations** on a NoSQL database  
âœ… Learned **query and scan operations** for efficient data retrieval  
âœ… Explored best practices for **partition keys and sort keys**  

## How to Use  

1. Open **`DynamoDB_Exercise.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Follow the step-by-step exercises to interact with DynamoDB.  
3. Compare your results with **`DynamoDB_Solution.ipynb`** if needed.  

## Requirements  

To run this project, ensure you have:  

- **Jupyter Notebook** installed  
- An **AWS account** with access to DynamoDB  
- **Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)** installed for interacting with DynamoDB  

## Additional Notes  

- Some sections in the project are **optional** and can be skipped.  
- External resources are linked for further learning.
