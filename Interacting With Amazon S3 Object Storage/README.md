# Working with AWS Object Storage and Amazon S3  

## Overview  

This project focuses on **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**, one of the most widely used **object storage solutions** in the cloud. The primary objectives include:  

- Creating and managing an **S3 bucket**  
- Uploading and querying **structured (CSV), semi-structured (JSON), and unstructured (image) data**  
- Exploring **object versioning** in S3  
- Interacting with S3 using both the **AWS Management Console** and **Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)**  

## Project Structure  

The repository consists of the following files:  

- **`S3_Exercise.ipynb`** â€“ A Jupyter Notebook containing guided exercises for working with Amazon S3.  
- **`S3_Solution.ipynb`** â€“ A solution notebook with completed queries and explanations for reference.  

## Learning Objectives  

By completing this project, I have:  

âœ… Understood the fundamentals of **Amazon S3 and object storage**  
âœ… Created and managed an **S3 bucket**  
âœ… Worked with **object versioning** to track changes in stored data  
âœ… Uploaded and queried **CSV, JSON, and image files** in S3  
âœ… Used **Boto3** to interact with S3 programmatically  

## How to Use  

1. Open **`S3_Exercise.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Follow the step-by-step exercises to work with Amazon S3.  
3. Compare your results with **`S3_Solution.ipynb`** if needed.  

## Requirements  

To run this project, ensure you have:  

- **Jupyter Notebook** installed  
- An **AWS account** with permissions to access S3  
- **Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)** installed  

## Additional Notes
