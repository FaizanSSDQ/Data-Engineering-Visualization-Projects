# Automated Data Validation with Great Expectations on AWS

This project demonstrates the implementation of automated data validation using Great Expectations on AWS, ensuring data quality and reliability in a production environment.

## Project Description

This project focuses on automating data validation processes by leveraging Great Expectations to create and manage expectation suites and checkpoints. It emphasizes the importance of moving from manual validation to an automated, scalable approach suitable for production environments. The project also showcases how to configure Data Docs storage on AWS S3, ensuring proper documentation and artifact management.

## Key Features

* **Automated Data Validation:** Implementation of Checkpoint objects to automate data validation against stored expectation suites.
* **Modular Expectation Suites:** Creation of reusable expectation suites that can be applied across different data batches.
* **AWS S3 Integration:** Configuration of Data Docs storage on AWS S3 for secure and accessible documentation.
* **Batch Request Management:** Creation and management of batch requests for efficient data processing.
* **Production-Ready Validation:** Transition from manual to automated validation, suitable for production environments.
* **Workflow Flexibility:** Implementation of a data quality pipeline that can be triggered based on various events or schedules.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
    * Python 3.x installed.
    * Great Expectations library installed.
    * AWS CLI configured.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Great Expectations:**
    * Modify the `great_expectations.yml` file to configure your data source and Data Docs storage on S3.
    * Replace the placeholder `<GX-DOCS-BUCKET>` with your actual S3 bucket name.

5.  **Create Batch Requests and Validations List:**
    * Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to create batch requests and validations list.

6.  **Run Checkpoints:**
    * Execute the Checkpoint objects to validate data against expectation suites.

7.  **View Data Docs:**
    * Access the generated Data Docs in the configured S3 bucket.

## Architecture

The architecture includes:

* Great Expectations for data validation.
* AWS S3 for storing Data Docs.
* Jupyter Notebooks for project implementation.
