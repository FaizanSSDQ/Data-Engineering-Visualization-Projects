# California Housing Prices Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting housing prices in California using a dataset containing features related to geographical, demographic, and economic factors. We carried out comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and data preparation to build a foundation for implementing machine learning models that can predict housing prices (`medianHouseValue`). This repository serves as a step-by-step guide for EDA, data preprocessing, and machine learning modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:
- **longitude**: Distance westward within California.
- **latitude**: Distance northward within California.
- **housingMedianAge**: Median age of houses in a block.
- **totalRooms**: Total number of rooms in a block.
- **totalBedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in a block.
- **population**: Total population in a block.
- **households**: Total number of households in a block.
- **medianIncome**: Median income of households in a block (in tens of thousands of USD).
- **medianHouseValue**: Median house value for households in a block (in USD).
- **oceanProximity**: Location relative to the ocean (categorical).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Inspection
We started by inspecting the dataset using functions such as `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to gain an initial understanding of the data structure, data types, and presence of missing values.

### 2. Handling Missing Values
The `totalBedrooms` column contained 207 missing values. We explored different strategies to handle these missing values, including filling with median values, dropping rows, or using interpolation, based on the datasetâ€™s context and impact analysis.

### 3. Outlier Detection and Handling
Using boxplots and statistical measures such as the Interquartile Range (IQR), we identified potential outliers in numerical columns. We made a deliberate decision to retain these outliers based on their significance in housing market analysis.

### 4. Feature Analysis and Correlation
We conducted correlation analysis using a heatmap to identify relationships among numerical features. We examined strong correlations with the target variable (`medianHouseValue`) and any multicollinearity among predictors. Key predictors such as `medianIncome` were highlighted for further consideration.

### 5. Feature Engineering
- Created potential new features such as `rooms_per_household` and `bedrooms_per_room` to capture meaningful relationships and enhance model performance.
- Categorical data handling focused on encoding the `oceanProximity` feature using techniques like one-hot encoding.

### 6. Data Splitting
The dataset was split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` to ensure robust model evaluation and validation.

### 7. Scaling and Normalization (Future Considerations)
For algorithms sensitive to the scale of features (e.g., Linear Regression, KNN), we discussed normalization or standardization approaches. However, tree-based models do not necessarily require this step.

### 8. Implementing Machine Learning Models
- **Model Selection**: Plan to experiment with models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, etc.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for model optimization.

## Next Steps
- Implement machine learning models to predict `medianHouseValue`.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Explore model interpretability techniques such as feature importance analysis and SHAP values.
- Further enhance features based on domain insights and observed patterns.
