# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a heart disease dataset to identify patterns and relationships that may help predict the presence of heart disease in patients. By performing a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to gain valuable insights that will guide us in building predictive machine learning models. The dataset used contains various medical features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, chest pain types, and more, which are important indicators for assessing heart disease risk.

## Project Objectives
- To conduct a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the heart disease dataset.
- To identify significant features and relationships that may impact heart disease prediction.
- To prepare the data for building machine learning models to predict heart disease.
- To provide a foundation for further modeling, including model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following features:

- **age**: Age of the patient.
- **sex**: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0 = Typical Angina, 1 = Atypical Angina, 2 = Non-anginal Pain, 3 = Asymptomatic).
- **trtbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False).
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy).
- **thalachh**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **slp**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **caa**: Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy.
- **thall**: Thalium stress test result (0 = Null, 1 = Fixed defect, 2 = Normal, 3 = Reversible defect).
- **exng**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **output**: Target variable (1 = Presence of heart disease, 0 = Absence).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview
The EDA performed in this project includes the following steps:

1. **Initial Data Inspection**:
   - Loaded and inspected the dataset using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` methods to understand the structure, data types, and basic statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Identified and handled categorical and continuous features separately.
   - Checked for and confirmed the absence of missing values.

3. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Visualized the distribution of continuous variables using **histograms** and **boxplots**.
   - Examined categorical features using **count plots**.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Used a **correlation matrix** and **heatmap** to visualize relationships between continuous features.
   - Identified key features with potential influence on the target variable.

5. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the relationships between the target variable and other features using **pairplots** and other visualizations to understand how different factors may contribute to heart disease presence.

6. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Identified potential outliers using boxplots but retained them for further analysis due to the limited number of data points.

## Key Insights
- Certain features such as **age**, **cholesterol levels**, and **maximum heart rate achieved** exhibit strong relationships with the target variable.
- The dataset contains no missing values, allowing for smoother data preprocessing and modeling steps.
- There is a mix of continuous and categorical features, each requiring different handling techniques for feature engineering and modeling.

## Next Steps
### Machine Learning Modeling
- **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
- **Feature Engineering**: Consider creating new features or transformations based on observed patterns during EDA.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests** to predict heart disease.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance using techniques like **GridSearchCV**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to evaluate model performance.
