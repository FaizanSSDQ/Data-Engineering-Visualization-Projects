# Project: Implementing DataOps with Terraform

In this project, I used **[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro)**, an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool, to deploy a **database instance** via a **bastion host**. This project demonstrated how to automate infrastructure provisioning and management, ensuring consistency and scalability in a DataOps environment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:
1. **Automate Infrastructure Deployment**: Use Terraform to provision a database instance and a bastion host.
2. **Ensure Secure Access**: Configure the bastion host to securely access the database instance.
3. **Apply DataOps Principles**: Implement infrastructure as code to streamline deployment and management processes.

---

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Defined and managed infrastructure using Terraform configuration files.
- **Bastion Host**: Set up a secure gateway for accessing the database instance.
- **Scalability**: Designed the infrastructure to be easily scalable for future needs.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensured consistent deployments across environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: For infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **AWS**: For hosting the database instance and bastion host.
- **Bastion Host**: For secure access to the database instance.
- **SSH Key Pair**: For secure authentication between the user and the bastion host.
- **CloudFormation**: For pre-configured networking resources (VPC, subnets).

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. **Terraform**: Install Terraform on your local machine.
2. **AWS Account**: Set up an AWS account and configure credentials.
3. **SSH Key Pair**: Generate an SSH key pair for secure access to the bastion host.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-dataops.git
   cd terraform-dataops
   ```
   
   
   
# Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in implementing DataOps principles using Terraform. By automating infrastructure deployment and ensuring secure access via a bastion host, I created a scalable and reproducible solution for managing database instances. This approach can be extended to other infrastructure components and cloud environments.
